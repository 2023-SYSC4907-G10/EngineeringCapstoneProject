This menu allows you to perform active attacks. Each button corresponds to an attack.
Below the button is the "heat bar". Each attack has its own unique heat. After every attack, the heat will increase.
If the heat is too high, the attack becomes less likely to suceed. Heat will go down if a different attack is used.
