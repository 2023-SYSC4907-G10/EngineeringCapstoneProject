In this game, you play as ransomware. You control the ransomware by your arrow keys or the WASD keys.
Your objective is to encrypt all files in the system. These files are redundant copies of the same data, and therefore all must be locked to win.
By keeping the ransomware on a file long enough, the data will change into a encrypted state denoted by the lock icon on the file.
The layout of the game is like a maze. This is to represent the difficulties of finding exploits in software systems.
The cops represent protection systems such as antivirus. If you let one of them touch you, then you will lose.
