Welcome to the Ethical Hacker cup! A fun internal security competition to help us improve our corporate security!
You are on the left side blue team, and to win the competition, you need to get respect from the judges
You gain respect from the judges by doing well in attack and defense minigames
To test the other team's security, go to the attack station to play attack test minigames
But, in order to play attack test minigames, you need to get enough opponent knowledge from doing passive attacks
You can inspect the other team's unlocked computers...
You can eavesdrop on their conversations...
You can also go dumpster diving to see what kind of info they're throwing out...
But beware, if you get caught doing a passive attack, you will be sent back to your team....
Once you have some attack minigame attempts, you can go to the defense station to upgrade your security concepts!
Watch out! The other team will conduct security tests on you! Make sure that you defend against them to avoid losing respect!
To win the game, you must fully upgrade all of your security concepts and gain respect from the judges! Good luck!
