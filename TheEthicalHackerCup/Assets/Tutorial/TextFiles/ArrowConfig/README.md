Arrow Config files are organized like so
position x,y,z rotation x,yz

Each line in the file corresponds to a tutorial state

ie. Tutorial with 4 states but 2 arrows one in the second state and one in the third state

`

0,0,0 0,0,45
-45,-123,0, 0,0,23

`

To find the positions and rotations you will need to play around with the arrows during runtime of the game scene
